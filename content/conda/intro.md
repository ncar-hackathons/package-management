# What is Conda?

[**conda**](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) is an **open source `package` and `environment` management system for any programming language**;
though it is quite popular in the python community.

## What is Anaconda?
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) is a distribution of conda. It is a data science platform that comes with a lot of packages.

## What is Miniconda?
Unlike Anaconda, Miniconda doesn't come with any installed packages by default.
Note that for miniconda, everytime you open up a terminal, `conda` won't automatically be available. Run the command below to use conda within miniconda.

## Install bash kernel
pip install bash_kernel
python -m bash_kernel.install
